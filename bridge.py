"""Python client for the FRDM-MCXA153 USB-to-I2C bridge firmware.

See https://github.com/wrouwet/frdm-mcxa153-usb-i2c-hub for the bridge
firmware itself. Talks to its USB CDC virtual COM port using its text
command protocol:

    S                                -> OK <addr> <addr> ...
    W <addr> <byte> [byte ...]       -> OK
    R <addr> <n>                     -> OK <byte> [byte ...]
    X <addr> <n> <byte> [byte ...]   -> OK <byte> [byte ...]
    I <addr> <ourAddr> <byte> ...    -> OK <byte> [byte ...]
    L <ourAddr>                      -> OK <byte> [byte ...]
    WS/RS/XS                        -> SMBus (adds/checks a trailing PEC
                                        byte) flavor of W/R/X, same args

This is a near-identical copy of the client living in the sibling
ipmi-test-environment project (same bridge firmware, same protocol)
-- duplicated rather than imported across repos so this project stays
independently clonable/runnable on its own, matching that project's own
"keep repos focused and self-contained" design. The one real difference
is the addition of smbus_write()/smbus_read()/smbus_write_read() below,
since MCTP-over-SMBus needs PEC on every frame and OpenBIC/IPMB never
did.

Auto-detects the right serial port by USB VID:PID rather than assuming
a fixed /dev/ttyACM number -- the bridge board's MCU-Link debug probe
exposes its own, unrelated ttyACM device, and which one gets which
number depends on enumeration order (a debug probe reconnecting can
swap them), not a fixed identity.

Verbose by design (see VERBOSE / _log() below): most of the real bugs
found while building the sibling IPMB suite were only findable at all
because we could see exactly what went out and came back on the wire,
and when, rather than a bare "it timed out". Printing too much here is
a deliberate trade against ever again staring at a generic timeout and
having to guess -- doubly so for this project, which starts out with
zero hardware verification (see this repo's README) and will need every
bit of wire-level visibility once real hardware testing starts.
